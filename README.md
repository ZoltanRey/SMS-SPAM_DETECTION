# **🚀 Machine Learning Classifier Performance Visualization**

This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for evaluating and visualizing the performance of various machine learning classifiers. The initial development was conducted in **Jupyter Notebook** 📒 for interactive coding and debugging. Later, the finalized code was structured and transitioned to **PyCharm** 🛠️ for creating a Python-based app.

---

## **✨ Features**
- 🧠 Implementation of multiple classifiers (SVC, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- 🔍 Automated accuracy and precision evaluation for each model.
- 📊 Performance visualization using **Seaborn** plots.
- 🛠️ Modular structure for easy scalability and integration into applications.

---

## **📂 Workflow**

### **1. Development in Jupyter Notebook** 📒
- ✅ Experimented with multiple classifiers and debugged issues interactively.
- 🖋️ Used `pandas` and `seaborn` for creating performance dataframes and visualizations.
- 🛡️ Debugged variable naming conflicts and ensured clean plots with proper labels.

### **2. Transition to PyCharm** 🛠️
- 🔄 Moved the finalized code from Jupyter to PyCharm for better structuring.
- 🗂️ Created Python scripts (`app.py`) for modularity and scalability.
- 🚀 Enhanced the project to work as a standalone app for running machine learning tasks.

## **📝 How to Use**

# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Set up the environment by installing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If not already installed, install Jupyter Notebook (Optional)
pip install notebook

# Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the initial code
jupyter notebook  # This will open a browser window with the project notebook

# Exit Jupyter Notebook once you're done exploring and developing in the notebook

# Open the project in PyCharm
# (Manually open PyCharm and load this repository to transition to the app script)

# Run the finalized Python application script using PyCharm's terminal or CLI
cd app/
python app.py

# Optional: Create a virtual environment for better dependency management
python -m venv venv       # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/MacOS)
venv\Scripts\activate     # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)

# Install the required libraries again in the virtual environment
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

# Add and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add finalized Python app and performance visualization"

# Push changes to the repository
git push origin main

# To deploy the app or share, package your application as needed
# (This could involve using additional tools or services, depending on your goals)
